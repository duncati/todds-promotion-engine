#Todd's Promotion Engine
This package demonstrates a base set of classes that store items in a cart while applying an optional set of promotions.
The promotions offer discounts for an item or a collection of items. A cart total price is computed from the items 
(both unpromoted and promoted) in the cart.

###How to Extend/Use
* Extend BasePromotion to create different promotion types
* Implement IRepository to create different data stores, add a new RepositoryType, and configure it in the RepositoryFactory.

###Assumptions
* The number of items of each sku will not exceed the maximum value of an integer: 2147483647 (hence int's are used
  throughout the code for adding/removing items, getting counts, etc.)
* Items and Cart do not need to be thread safe. I assume that there is only one process that is adding/removing items.
  (It's obviously easy to make them thread safe, and there's a very small performance cost for doing so.)

###Choices
* Monetary values should not be stored/computed as integers due to rounding inaccuracies. Nor should money be computed 
  as a double or a float since decimal point inaccuracies are guaranteed (3.14 can be stored as 3.1399999 which, when
  accumulated with other things over time will introduce errors). Storing money as a BigDecimal, while a syntactic 
  pain, is a great and safe way to compute monetary values.

###Future Improvements
* Change SKU objects from Strings to a concrete class (Sku is a good class name). Passing Strings around long term is a bad 
  idea, strict typing prevents future potential bugs.
* Implement the DatabaseRepository linking this engine to real data with a cache.
* Add decision logic (prioritization) for which promotions to apply to a cart. Presumably the promotion combination that
  gives the lowest cart cost would be preferred, or other schemes.
